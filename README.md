# 🎤 Video Compilation Page  
This repository contains my fourth basic HTML project, *VideoCompilationPage*, which I created to practice fundamental web development concepts.

- 🎶 A brief introduction about Taylor Swift  
- 📀 Sections highlighting albums like *Red*, *1989*, and *Reputation*  
- 📸 Videos of her iconic eras  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- HTML5
